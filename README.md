# docker-compose
This project is designed to introduce the key concepts of Docker Compose whilst building a simple Python web application. The application uses the Flask framework and maintains a hit counter in Redis.

# Prerequisites

You need to have Docker Engine and Docker Compose on your machine. You can either:

Install Docker Engine and Docker Compose as standalone binaries.  </br>
Install Docker Desktop which includes both Docker Engine and Docker Compose.  </br>
You donâ€™t need to install Python or Redis, as both are provided by Docker images. </br>
